# tacos.py - Collect taco components while it's raining tacos.

It's raining tacos! You control the taco shell. Use the mouse to move the
shell and collect meat, cheese, lettuce and sour cream as they fall from the
sky.

The game is written in Python 2.7.17 and pygame 1.9.4.post1. Artwork is my
own.
